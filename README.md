### TensorBoard Usage:

To visualize the training progress, use TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs/font_nikud_classifier
```

This will start a local server. You can access it by opening a web browser and going to: http://localhost:6006
You'll be able to view various metrics such as training loss over time, which helps monitor the training process.
